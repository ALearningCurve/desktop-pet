# desktop-pet
This is a python project that makes a desktop pet with animations that is interactable. Changing the appearance of the desktop pet is as easy as changing the sprite gif files in the 
sprites folder.

This project was inspired by
[blog post](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/create-your-own-desktop-pet-with-python-5b369be18868),
but it has been changed and improved a lot.
